The macOS color panel has some annoying limitations:
* Can only be accessed through an app that contains a color well
* Disappears when the app that displayed it is no longer key
* Can't organize your favorite colors

Color Picker is meant to address those issues. It is a standalone app, so it is easily accessible and always visible. Users can save their favorite colors to "Palettes".

## Build

Tested on Xcode 9 and macOS 10.13.
